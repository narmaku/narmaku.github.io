Hello 👋 Welcome to my personal blog.

I'm Nico, Software Engineer with over a decade of experience in the IT Industry. I am passionate about Technology 🤖 since I was a kid.

I also enjoy hobbies such as martial arts 🥋, videogames 🕹️, table-tennis 🏓 and more ✨. However, what I love the most is to spend quality time with my family 👨‍👨‍👧‍👦💞.

I live in Japan 🏯 since November 2022. I may post random articles about life here 🇯🇵.

I hope you enjoy my site!

Nico
