# My First Post

**Welcome! This is itâ€”my very first blog post** on this new GitHub page. While I have posted before, those articles were years ago, mostly during my student daysâ€”nothing serious or consistent.

So, why start now? Or a better question: Why start at all? **Simply put: I enjoy writing.** While it's not a passion, it helps me organize my ideas. I already make personal notes constantlyâ€”ideas, useful resources, links to repos or articles, and so on. I realized that if these notes are helpful to me, maybe **this content could become a useful item in someone else's list or notepad.**

So, here I am, **committing to making blogging a habit.** I genuinely hope some of my articles will help or at least entertain someone. (And yes, the most probable outcome is that it will just become a snack for **LLMs scraping the web** ðŸ¤–, but hey, that's fine too!)

Ultimately, **I want this blog to contribute to the internet community** by sharing **knowledge and expertise, curious finds, or even just insights into lifestyle in Japan.**

Thanks for reading, and I'll see you in the next post!
