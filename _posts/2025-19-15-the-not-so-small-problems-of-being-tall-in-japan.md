## The (Not-So) Small Problems of Being Tall in Japan

I usually stick to tech and AI on this blog, but as I mentioned in my first post, I also want to share occasional insights into lifestyle in Japan. Well, today’s topic is one I run into—quite literally—every single day: life as a tall person here.

For context, I’m 185cm (about 6'1"). Back in Spain, this is definitely tall, but not exceptionally so. In Japan? It’s a different story. It presents some... let's call them "daily ergonomic challenges."

If you’re my height or taller and planning to visit or live here, consider this a public service announcement.

### The Daily "Duck and Cover"

Let's start with the basics: just moving around. In many traditional Japanese houses (like at a relative's home) or older buildings, the doorframes are... low. I have lost count of the number of times I've misjudged and slammed my head into a doorframe. It hurts. A lot. You learn to adopt a permanent slight hunch, just in case.

Then there are the restaurants. I love Japanese food, but I’m always a bit wary of traditional places that only have *zashiki* seating—the low tables on tatami mats. As someone who is not only tall and heavy but also famously inflexible, trying to fold my legs into a *seiza* (kneeling) position is a non-starter. Even sitting cross-legged is a challenge, and my knees often end up higher than the table.

### The Great Shopping Odyssey

This is, by far, the biggest challenge. Finding clothes and shoes is an adventure.

For clothes, it's not impossible. Stores like GU or Uniqlo have expanded their online sizes, and I can sometimes find basics or roomwear that fits. I also stick to Costco a lot, since they often carry US-size-labeled items alongside the Japanese-sized ones. But for anything else, the selection is incredibly thin.

The *real* **odyssey**, however, is finding shoes. My feet are 30-31cm (a US 12-13, depending on the brand). This was already a quest in Spain, but in Japan, it’s an even greater one.

I’ve tried everything:
* Ordering from Amazon Japan (limited selection).
* Buying second-hand shoes from eBay, shipped directly from the USA.
* Buying several pairs in Spain whenever I travel back home.
* Visiting even the biggest outlets in Japan, like the one in Karuizawa (no luck, not even there).
* Checking on "tall size" or specielizae stores online.

I’ve had some wins and many losses. Amazon shoes from random brands were terrible and had to be thrown out (very poor quality). Others were okay but cost a fortune in shipping and import taxes, even more expensive than the shoes themselves.

At one point, I got desperate and tried to "make it work" with shoes that were slightly too small, thinking, "Oh, it'll be fine, I don't walk *that* much as I work remotely." This was a terrible, terrible idea. After about a month, my feet were in constant pain, and I developed a lovely Morton's neuroma in my right foot.

Lesson learned: never compromise on shoe size, and buy good quality shoes even if they are expensive.

### Getting Around: Toasters and Trains

Transportation is its own adventure.

**Trains:** Thankfully, most trains are quite comfortable and spacious. My absolute favorite is the **Shinkansen** (bullet train)—it's roomy, blazing fast, and just an incredible piece of engineering. For daily commuting, regular trains are generally fine, making this my preferred way to travel (and my kids enjoy it too).

**Buses:** This is another story. My kids absolutely *love* riding the bus, so I make the effort from time to time. But the seats are always narrow and low, meaning my legs are jammed against the seat in front of me, and the aisles are so tight I have to turn sideways to walk down them. I try to avoid buses when I can.

**Cars:** And then there are the cars. I've had a chance to drive *kei* cars (the yellow-plate light automobiles) and they feel like toys. I just don't feel particularly safe in them. For a while, we had a **Mitsubishi Delica D2**, which isn't *technically* a *kei* car, but it's "almost" one. It was small, weak, and clearly designed 100% for the domestic market. Driving it was so uncomfortable that my right leg, arm, shoulder, and neck ended up in a permanent state of contracture. We eventually switched to a larger wagon/minivan model, which is a massive improvement, but even then, you can feel the Japanese-oriented ergonomics.

### The Futon-Mattress dilemma

Finally, let's talk about sleep.

The Futon: My main issue? They are too short. My feet inevitably hang off the bottom, which is not only cold in the winter but also doesn't feel great for blood circulation. They are also, by design, very thin. When sleeping on my side, I could feel the hard floor digging into my hips.

My "partial solution" has been to find a foldable mattress from an Italian manufacturer. It’s significantly thicker (a huge win for my hips) and slightly longer (198cm). My body is in much less pain now, although I still need a good massage to fix my contractures from time to time.

The full solution, of course, would be a full-fledged Western-style bed. But with two very young children (2 and 3), it feels a bit dangerous. Not just because they might fall off, but also... let's just say expensive mattresses and "toddler fluids" don't mix well. So, I’m thinking this one over!

Is it all bad? Absolutely not. It’s just one of the quirks of living abroad. You adapt, you find solutions (like Italian mattresses!), and you learn to duck. A lot.

I have heard that the younger generations in Japan are getting taller and taller, so maybe in a few decades, these "tall people problems" will be a thing of the past.

Thanks for reading, and I'll see you in the next post!
